The purpose of this game is to destroy any oncoming asteroids that come towards you. Be sure not to be
hit by them or you will lose the game! The top right counts how many points you have gotten for destroying
the asteroids and when you lose, on the top right you will see a text to press 'R' after losing (getting hit
by the asteroid). However, if you are feeling slow, there is a way to boost your speed! Hold down a
directional move button (W - forward, A - right, S - backwards, D - left) and tapping 'F' you will glide
much faster! Good luck! Have fun!
